# INTRODUCTION

The tradiational wiper systems use winshield wiper which works intermittently with varying speeds. A typical wiper control stalk. Most wipers have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously. But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wiper. In this system we have used an STM32F407 discovery board along with the LED's . Where each LED will be showing the position of the wipr on the winshield.
