# INTRODUCTION

The tradiational wiper systems use winshield wiper which works intermittently with varying speeds. A typical wiper control stalk. Most wipers have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously. But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wiper. In this system we have used an STM32F407 discovery board along with the LED's . Where each LED will be showing the position of the wipr on the winshield.

# OBJECTIVE

a)To build a system that can receive input and generate automatically output in easy way and short time.
b) To build a monitoring system that is able to monitor and manage all operations efficiently.
c) Give an opportunity to drivers to reduce mistakes that always happen during manual method.

# BENIFITS

a) Record Maintenance.
b) Saves Time and Cost.
c) Increases Efficiency.
d) Simple and Easy to Use.

 ## WHAT
 A windshield wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms. The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear     view for the driver and passenger.

## WHY
The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger. A specially-shaped rubber wiping lip ensures an optimal wiping result.

## WHERE
The windshield wipers can be activated by a lever located to the right of the steering wheel. Pulling the lever down should activate the windshield wipers on their lowest setting. Pulling the level in towards you should cause the wipers to swipe just once across the windshield.

## WHEN
A windscreen wiper, windshield wiper or wiper blade (American English) is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window.

## HOW
This system sprays water, or an antifreeze window washer fluid, at the windscreen using several well-positioned nozzles. This system helps remove dirt or dust from the windscreen when it is used in concert with the wiper blades. When antifreeze washer fluid is used, it can help the wipers remove snow or ice.
